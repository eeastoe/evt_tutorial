This repository contains material for the Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) session of the Data Science Training Course held in 
conjunction with the International Glaciological Society's British Branch Annual Meeting 2017.

The repository contains three directories containing: (i) the slides for the presentations, (ii) worksheets and (iii) data for 
use in the workshop. Worksheets cover two areas of EVA: models for (i) annual maxima/minima data and (ii) peaks over threshold 
data.

To complete the workshops you will need to install R on your computer and also the extRemes and lubridate packages. For more
information on how to do this check the manuals and frequently asked questions at https://www.r-project.org/.
